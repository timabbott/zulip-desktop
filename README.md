# Download
You can download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/releases/latest) page.

## Prerequisites
* node >= v6.9.4
> Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to install the current stable version of node


* python (v2.7.x recommended)
* If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, you'll need to install following packages:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev
```

* If you're on Windows, you'll need to install following package as administrator:
```sh
C:\Windows\system32> npm install -g windows-build-tools
```
Note:
> Computers running on Windows OS may encounter problems when installing the Electron app. As Windows does not come bundled with a C++ compiler, which is needed in NodeJS, the command prompt may throw up an error which states that node-gyp rebuild fails on your system. Hence it is advised a further prerequisite (for Windows users) is to download Visual Studio Community 2015 which contains a C++ compiler using the above command.



## Installation

Clone the source locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron
$ cd zulip-electron
```

Install project dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```
Start the app:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Start and watch changes  

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
# Making a release

To package app into an installer use command:
```
npm run dist
```
It will start the packaging process for operating system you are running this command on. Ready for distribution file (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package) will be outputted to `dist` directory.

You can create Windows installer only when running on Windows, the same is true for Linux and OSX. So to generate all three installers you need all three operating systems.
